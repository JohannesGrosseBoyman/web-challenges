/*
Let's calculate some interesting facts based on the age of a user! It is expected that the user of this program provides a number as the input. The code for receiving this input is provided below.

Calculate the following:
- The number of days the person has lived.
- The expected number of remaining days for the person. Use an expected life span of 80 years.
- The percentage of already lived days in relation to the life expectancy.
- The cumulative number of days the person already slept in their life. Assume the person sleeps on average 8 hours per day.

Make sure to log every number with a nice descriptive text. Hint: you can combine text by using "+"

ðŸ’¡ You can ignore leap years.

const currentAge = Number(process.argv[2]); // this gives you the <age> the user entered in the command "nodex index.js <age>"

console.log("Your current age is: " + currentAge, " years.");
let livedDaysalready = currentAge * 365;
console.log("You already lived: ", livedDaysalready, " days.");
let totalExpectedDays = 80 * 365;
console.log("We assume your whole life span has: ", totalExpectedDays, "days.");
let percentageOfExpectedDays = (livedDaysalready / totalExpectedDays) * 100;
console.log(
  "You lived already ",
  percentageOfExpectedDays,
  " % of your total expected days."
);
